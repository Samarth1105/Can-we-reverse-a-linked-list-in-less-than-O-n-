# No, it is not possible to reverse a singly linked list in less than O(n) time complexity, where n is the number of nodes in the list.

- Traversal Requirement: To reverse a singly linked list, you need to visit each node at least once because the list is linear, and each node contains a reference only to its next node
- Reversing Each Pointer: For each node, you must reverse its next pointer to point to the previous node. This requires visiting each node, which contributes to O(n) operations.
- Linear Access: Unlike an array, where you can access any element in constant time, in a singly linked list, you can only move from one node to the next.
